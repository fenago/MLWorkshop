
1. Open command prompt on your system.
2. Create a new folder where you wish to include 
all the project related files 
(suppose the name of the folder is “temp”)
3. Now, run the following command:

python -m venv mlworkbook

Here, venv is a package inbuilt in python which is used for creating and manging environments. mlworkbook is the name of the environment

4. After entering, it will create the virtual 
environment with the name mlworkbook. 
We can activate this by running the following command: 

mlworkbook\Scripts\activate

When you hit enter, it will activate the mlworkbook 
names environments. After this activation, if you 
run pip install, it will install the packages 
within this environment. 

To identify that your virtual environment is active, 
you can see on the left-hand side of your command 
prompt, there will be a name of your environment. 

 

while this environment is active, we can run the same 
freeze command we ran earlier and now this time, 
it will only make a requiremnst.txt file with the 
packages of this environment. 

 
To deactivate, we can just run the following command:

deactivate
