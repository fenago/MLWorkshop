1.	We could just run the following 
    command from the terminal to create 
    a requirements.txt file with a list 
    of all the packages currently installed 
    on our python system:

    pip freeze > requirements.txt

what this command will do is to install all the 
packages which are currently there on our python 
system. It will work but is inefficient because our 
app might just be dependent on a few packages such 
as sklearn, panadas, pickle etc.
